# Smart_Home_App
A Mobile App to control several things around the house

So far the general Idea is that I will have Arduino and Pi controlling and monitoring things around the house and then have those controlled by a mobile app, ideally I would like to have it work via the internet instead of Bluetooth, but we will see.
This is something I have been thinking up for a while and think it will be a great learning opportunity for me.
Feel free to contact me for whatever.

## Folder layout
The folder tree will look something like this:

#Base Dir.
##Mobile App.
###SmartHomeAPK.
##Modules.
###A Dir per room or sub network.
##Folder for 3d prints.
##Documentation.
